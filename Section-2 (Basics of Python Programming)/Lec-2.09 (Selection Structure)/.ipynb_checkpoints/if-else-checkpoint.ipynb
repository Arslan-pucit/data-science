    "## 1. Python Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code. A block is a combination of all these statements. Block can be regarded as the grouping of statements for a specific purpose. Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation to highlight the blocks of code. Whitespace is used for indentation in Python. All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right. You can understand it better by looking at the following lines of code. Python uses 4 spaces as indentation by default. However, the number of spaces is up to you, but a minimum of 1 space has to be used. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. "
