    "1. **Header:**  At the top of the notebook document is the header which contains the _notebook title_, _menu bar_, and _toolbar_, which are used to control notebook navigation and document structure.\n",
    "2. **Body:** The body of a notebook is composed of cells. Each cell contains either markdown, code input, code output, or raw text.\n",
    "3. **Types of cells:**\n",
    "    - **Markdown cells** are used to build a nicely formatted narrative around the code in the document. These cells can either be rendered or unrendered. When they are rendered, a nice formatted representation of the cell's contents will be presented. When they are unrendered, the raw text source of the cell will be presented.\n",
    "    - **Code cells**  are used to define the computational code in the document. They come in two forms:\n",
    "        - **Input cell** where the user types the code to be executed, and  \n",
    "        - **output cell** which is the representation of the executed code. Depending on the code, this representation may be a simple scalar value, or something more complex like a plot or an interactive widget.\n",
    "    -**Raw cells:** These are used when text needs to be included in raw form, without execution or transformation.\n",
    "4. **Modes of a cell:**\n",
    "    - **Edit mode** is indicated by a **green** cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area. When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing `Enter` or using the mouse to click on a cell's editor area.\n",
    "    - **Command mode** is indicated by a **blue** cell border. When in command mode, the structure of the notebook can be modified as a whole, but the text in individual cells cannot be changed. Most importantly, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts for efficiently performing notebook and cell actions. Enter command mode by pressing `Esc` or using the mouse to click *outside* a cell's editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Keyboard Short cuts:** Keyboard shortcuts are a very popular aspect of the Jupyter environment because they facilitate a speedy cell-based workflow. Following shortcuts work in command mode:\n",
    "    - Press H to see the list of short cuts\n",
    "    - Shift+Enter to execute code of a code-cell and to render the contents of a markdown cell. It also shifts control to cell down. If there is none it creates one. To avoid shifting control to lower cell after you execute a cell code use <Ctrl+Enter> instead\n",
    "    - Scroll up and down your cells with your Up and Down keys.\n",
    "    - Press A or B to insert a new cell above or below the active cell.\n",
    "    - DD (D twice) will delete the active cell.\n",
    "    - L to toggle view linenumbers within a cell\n",
    "    - Z will undo cell deletion. \n",
    "    - M will transform the active cell to a Markdown cell.\n",
    "    - Y will set the active cell to a code cell.\n",
    "    - <Command+/> to toggle between commenting and uncommenting the current LOC or highlighted LOCs\n",
    "    - Hold Shift and press Up or Down to select multiple cells at once. With multiple cells selected, Shift + M will merge your selection."
