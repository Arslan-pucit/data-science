    "- **Syntax Errors or Parsing Errors:** are errors that are raised before the program/script actually starts its execution. Some common parsing errors in Python are: incorrect indentation, leaving out a symbol (e.g., collon or bracket), empty block. \n",
    "- **Exceptions:** Python generates an exception object (representing error) that is raised during execution of a syntactically correct program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's execution. \n",
    "- **Exception Handling:** Handling the exception object appropriately to avoid abrupt crashing of your program is called exception handling.\n",
    "- Some common exceptions in Python are:\n",
    "   - **ZeroDivisionError** is raised when you perform a division by zero.\n",
    "   - **ValueError** is raised when a function or built-in operation receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "   - **NameError** is raised when the Python interpreter encounters a symbol that does not exist.\n",
    "   - **TypeError** is raised when you try performing an operation on unsupported types (e.g., 5 + 'hello').\n",
    "   - **IndexError** is raised when you try to refer a sequence which is out of range.\n",
    "   - **IOError** is raised when an IO operation fails, e.g.,  trying to open a file that do not exist.\n",
    "   - **EOFError** is raised when built-in function like input() hits an end of file condition, without reading any data.\n",
    "   - **ImportError** is raised when an import statement fails to find the module.\n",
    "   - **AssertionError** is raised when an assert statement fails (an assert statement allows you to create simple debug message outputs based on simple logical assertions).\n",
    "- Two main categories of exceptions in programming are:\n",
    "    - **Checked Exceptions** are the exceptions which occur at compile time (e.g., file not found, no such function). Since Python is not compiled, so checked exceptions don't make much sense.\n",
    "    - **Unchecked Exception** are the exceptions which are not checked by the compiler (e.g., arithmetic exception, array out of bound). If not handled by programmer properly, the program terminate at runtime. "
